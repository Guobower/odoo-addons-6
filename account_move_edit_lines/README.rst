========================
Account Move Edit Lines
========================

This module allows for editing account moves which are posted or partially reconciled.
In particular, this is useful when there is a specific need to update payment terms
e.g. from invoices which are already partially paid.

The wizard can be called from account moves or move lines. A button "split line" is also
available on move lines, the line is directly split between paid and unpaid amount.
